   cd web-scraper-tester
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the Python script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python web_scraper_tester.py
   ```

2. **Output:**

   - The program will send a GET request to [https://webscraper.io/test-sites](https://webscraper.io/test-sites).
   - It will parse the returned HTML and output the first `<div>` element found on the page.

3. **Customization:**

   - Modify the `url` variable in the script to target a different web page.
   - Extend the BeautifulSoup extraction logic to capture more elements or different tags.

## How It Works üîç

- **HTTP Request:**  
  The script uses the `requests.get()` method to retrieve the HTML content from the target URL.

- **HTML Parsing:**  
  `BeautifulSoup` is used with the `"lxml"` parser to efficiently process and navigate the HTML structure.

- **Element Extraction:**  
  The code prints out the first `<div>` element found, demonstrating how to extract HTML elements for further analysis.

## Customization üé®

You can enhance the project with various modifications:
- **Extended Scraping:**  
  Extract additional elements such as `<p>`, `<a>`, and more.
- **Data Storage:**  
  Save the scraped data to a file or database.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Implement additional error handling for network requests and parsing issues.
- **User Input:**  
  Modify the script to accept a URL input from the user for dynamic scraping.
